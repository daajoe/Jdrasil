# Jdrasil â€“ A Modular Library for Computing Tree Decompositions

Jdrasil is a modular Java library for computing tree
decompositions both, exact and heuristically. The goal of Jdrasil is
to allow other projects to add tree decompositions to their
applications as easy as possible. In order to achieve this, Jdrasil
is designed in a very modular way: Every algorithm is implemented as
interchangeable as possible. At the same time, algorithms are
implemented in a clean object oriented manner, making it easy to
understand and extend the implementation. We hope that this approach
makes it easier to study the practical aspects of tree width
algorithms, and that it helps to push the practical usage of tree
decompositions.
